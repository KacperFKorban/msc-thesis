TODO:
- Expand the thesis to make it longer and more comprehensive overall.
- Provide a definition for LIST_REL in Figure 3.1.
- Consider presenting the derivation tree as a bullet point list, including the steps of the proof and relevant rules used.
- Add more explanation and text to the proof in the theorem proved by induction on subst_rel. Describe the interesting cases, crucial properties, and relevant helper definitions/lemmas.
- Similarly, provide a more detailed explanation of the significance of Theorem 7.
- Include explanations of exp_eq and congruences for it in the Background chapter, under PureCake, ensuring it is understandable to outsiders.
- Split Chapter 3 into two chapters: "Verified Inlining at the Abstract Level" and "Verified Implementation of Inlining." Move content from Section 3.5 onwards to the new chapter.
- In the new implementation chapter, provide more information about the proofs.
- Expand Chapter 5 (Results chapter).
- Review and revise the final chapter to make it less "bullet point"-like and more substantial.
