# TODOs

General:
- Expand the thesis to make it longer and more comprehensive overall.
- Expand Chapter 5 (Results chapter).
<!-- - Review and revise the final chapter to make it less "bullet point"-like and more substantial. -->

Proofs:
<!-- - Add more explanation and text to the proof in the theorem proved by induction on subst_rel. Describe the interesting cases, crucial properties, and relevant helper definitions/lemmas. -->
- Similarly, provide a more detailed explanation of the significance of Theorem 7. (deep_subst_rel t u â‡’ t =~ u)
- In the new implementation chapter, provide more information about the proofs.

New explanations:
<!-- - Include explanations of exp_eq and congruences for it in the Background chapter, under PureCake, ensuring it is understandable to outsiders. -->
<!-- - Provide a definition for LIST_REL in Figure 3.1. -->

Derivation trees: (revisit)
<!-- - Consider presenting the derivation tree as a bullet point list, including the steps of the proof and relevant rules used. -->
