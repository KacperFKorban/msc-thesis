# TODOs

General:
<!-- - Expand the thesis to make it longer and more comprehensive overall. -->
<!-- - Expand Chapter 5 (Results chapter). -->
<!-- - Review and revise the final chapter to make it less "bullet point"-like and more substantial. -->

Proofs:
<!-- - Add more explanation and text to the proof in the theorem proved by induction on subst_rel. Describe the interesting cases, crucial properties, and relevant helper definitions/lemmas. -->
<!-- - Similarly, provide a more detailed explanation of the significance of Theorem 7. (deep_subst_rel t u â‡’ t =~ u) -->
<!-- - In the new implementation chapter, provide more information about the proofs. -->
<!-- - Expand the specialization explanation -->

New explanations:
<!-- - Include explanations of exp_eq and congruences for it in the Background chapter, under PureCake, ensuring it is understandable to outsiders. -->
<!-- - Provide a definition for LIST_REL in Figure 3.1. -->

Derivation trees: (revisit)
<!-- - Consider presenting the derivation tree as a bullet point list, including the steps of the proof and relevant rules used. -->

Other changes:
- Check if I can use the PureCake graphic

Used HOL definitions:
<!-- - MEM -->
<!-- - MAP2 -->
<!-- - DISJOINT -->
<!-- - LIST_REL -->


Used PureCake definitions:
<!-- - freevars -->
<!-- - boundvars -->
<!-- - closed -->
<!-- - exp_of -->
<!-- - exp_eq -->

Used PureCake definitions introduced in this project:
- freevars_of
- vars_of
- binds_ok
- no_shadowing

Feedback 2:
- Around Theorem 1, the font used in the surrounding text doesn't match the font used in the theorem. Try using \HOLtm{f} etc.
- More wrong fonts in Chapter 3.
- There seems to be typos in the derivation tree just before Section 3.3.1. The conclusion is missing parenthesis.
- I would have liked the first paragraph (i.e. the "chapter abstract) to be much more upfront that the specialisation pass has not been verified yet. Its verification is left as future work.
