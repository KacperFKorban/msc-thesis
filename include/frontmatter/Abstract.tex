\section*{Abstract}
This thesis describes the implementation and formal verification of an inlining
optimization pass for the PureCake compiler. PureCake is a verified optimizing
compiler for a pure, lazy, functional programming language. The optimization is
implemented and verified using the HOL4 theorem prover. The correctness proof of
inlining is defined at two levels of abstraction. The meta-theory level and the
compiler level. The implementation is heuristic agnostic and can be used with
any inlining strategy. The thesis also describes a function specialization
transformation. This transformation is unverified, but steps are described on
how the current inlining implementation and methodology can be used to verify
it.
