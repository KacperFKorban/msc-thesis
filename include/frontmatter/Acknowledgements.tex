\section*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to thank my supervisor Magnus Myreen for his support and guidance throughout this project. I would also like to thank the members of the PureCake team for sharing their knowledge of the project during weekly meetings. Especially Michael Norrish for his HOL4 tips and Hrutvik Kanabar for implementing the freshening pass.
